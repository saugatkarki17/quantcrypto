# Crypto Decoupling Detector (Alpha Hunter)

### A Regime-Based Quantitative Dashboard for Digital Assets

## Key Terminologies
1. **Alpha:** Return above what is expected given the asset’s risk profile.
2. **Idiosyncratic alpha:** Idiosyncratic alpha is excess return generated by security-specific drivers, independent of systematic market or factor exposures.
3. **Decouple:** Decoupling occurs when an asset’s returns diverge from market or factor-driven behavior, indicating that performance is driven by asset-specific fundamentals rather than systematic risk.
---

## Executive Summary
The **Crypto Decoupling Detector** is a real-time quantitative tool designed to identify **Unique Alpha** in the digital asset market. 

Crypto markets are highly correlated during stress. When volatility spikes:
* Most assets follow Bitcoin
* Portfolio diversification collapses
* Risk becomes systematic, not asset-specific

During this time crypto assets often move in lockstep (Correlation $\approx$ 1), making the idea of traditional portfolio diversification useless. This dashboard calculates **Rolling Correlation Windows** to detect moments when specific assets "decouple" from the benchmark (Bitcoin), signaling potential return or specific risk events.

## Investment Thesis
Most retail analytics focus on price prediction. This tool focuses on **Market Structure Analysis**.

1.  **The Problem (Systematic Risk):** During macro panic events, correlation across the crypto sector approaches 1.0. Buying "diverse" coins during these times does not reduce risk.
2.  **The Opportunity (Idiosyncratic Alpha):** The most profitable trades occur when an asset breaks its correlation with the broader market due to fundamental catalysts.
3.  **The Solution:** By moving from static correlation to **Dynamic Rolling Correlation**, this tool highlights exactly *when* an asset is trading on its own fundamentals rather than following the macro trend (compare with multiple assets).

## Features

### 1. Dynamic Regime Detection
* **Lockstep Regime ($r > 0.8$):** High systematic risk. The asset is just mimicking Bitcoin.
* **Decoupled Regime ($r < 0.5$):** High idiosyncratic behavior, potential Alpha opportunity.
* **Inverse Regime ($r < 0$):** The asset is acting as a hedge, reduce or offset the risk of another position..

### 2. Rolling Correlation Engine
Calculates the Pearson Correlation Coefficient ($r$) over a user-defined sliding window (default 30 days). This removes noise and visualizes the *trend* of relationships, not just the snapshot.

### 3. Institutional Visualization
* **Correlation Matrix Heatmaps:** Instant view of sector-wide contagion.
* **Normalized Performance:** Relative strength comparison starting from a common base (Base 100).

## Methodology

The core engine relies on the **Pearson Correlation Coefficient** applied to a rolling window of log-returns:

$$
r_{xy} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{\sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(x_i - \bar{x})^2} \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(y_i - \bar{y})^2}}
$$

Where:
* $x$ = Benchmark Returns (BTC)
* $y$ = Asset Returns (like ETH)
* $n$ = Rolling Window Size (30-60 Days)

This methodology measures how closely an asset’s returns (like SOL or ETH) move with a benchmark (BTC) over a rolling 30-day window. The Pearson Correlation Coefficient ranges from –1 to 1, indicating whether the asset moves in the same direction, opposite, or independently of BTC. By tracking this correlation over time, you can identify when an asset decouples from BTC or potentially acts as a hedge.
